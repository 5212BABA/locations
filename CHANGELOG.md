- Changed Liberia level 2 name to "zone or district"

## [1.6.0] 20.02.2015

### Added
Add DHIS locations for Liberia, deprecate current ones, see story
1149. This is not breaking because currently there are just locations
belonging to county `1`, Montserrado, in the database. We are keeping
them, although we are changing the name in order to make it clear that
they are deprecated
